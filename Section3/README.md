# Section 3

This section of the course involved
* Copying the *_Mod variants of the assets into a collection named "High"
* Running Voxel Remesh to rebuild the geometry with a more uniform topology and a higher resoltion
* Adding the Multiresolution modifier to geometry to increase the resolution event further
* Sculpting the objects to add wear, tear, nicks, scrapes and scratches

This has not been recorded in the repository as the Blender file grw to 3.5 GiB when all objects were
at the highest resolution and there were multiple versions of the geometry. Versioning this size geometry
in GitHub is not possible without significant expense.
