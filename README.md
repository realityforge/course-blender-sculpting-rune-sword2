# Coursework for "Blender Sculpting - Rune Sword"

This contains the work created when completing the course [Blender Sculpting - Rune Sword](https://www.udemy.com/course/blender-sculpting-rune-sword/).

The course involved the creation of a "Rune Sword" model. Section 1 of the course was a
course introduction. In Section 2, a low-poly mesh of the sword is created. In Section 3,
the resolution of the mesh was increased and fine details were sculpted into the mesh. The
final section involved decimating the sculpted mesh, realigning the sculpted mesh and the
low poly mesh and developing a useful UV mapping.
